After a successful test post from a Google doc to my new Jekyll-based blog, I expect to be making any new blog posts here at [http://blog.acritch.com/](http://blog.acritch.com/) for the foreseeable future.

For posts made between 2014 and 2018, visit [http://acritch.com/blog](http://acritch.com/blog).

For even older posts, made between 2010 and 2012 under the username "Academian", visit [https://www.lesswrong.com/users/academian?view=frontpage](https://www.lesswrong.com/users/academian?view=frontpage).

*Note: This post was actually made on 2018-03-24, but it's dated to 2001-01-01 to make sure it appears as the last post in this blog.*
